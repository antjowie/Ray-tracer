## Day 1
* Introduction
* Template
* Whitted style recap
* RT-centric Game Dev

### Introduction
* Mon  
**None**
* Thu  
**A solid Whitted style ray tracer**  
Render time: 11s
* Fri  
Optimization -> SIMD -> **5x faster**
* Mon  
Accel structures -> refitting -> **perhaps realtime**
* Thu  
Monte-Carlo, many polish -> path tracing -> **Cook or (DOF, area lights) Kajiya (path tracer)**
* Tue  
Even faster, quality of randomness -> sampling, estimation -> **Efficiency**
* Fri  
Future work -> path guiding -> **Great product**
