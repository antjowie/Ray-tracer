* RT-centric Game Dev

### Introduction
* Mon 1  
**None**
* Thu 2  
**A solid Whitted style ray tracer**  
* Fri 3  
Optimization -> SIMD -> **5x faster**
* Mon 4  
Accel structures -> refitting -> **perhaps realtime**
* Thu 5  
Monte-Carlo, many polish -> path tracing -> **Cook or (DOF, area lights) Kajiya (path tracer)**
* Tue 6  
Even faster, quality of randomness -> sampling, estimation -> **Efficiency**
* Fri 7  
Future work -> path guiding -> **Great product**
